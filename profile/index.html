            <div class="words">I’m Kai Wang. I’m a designer who codes. I'm also the author of Laying the Foundations (a book about design systems). I’ve worked internationally, in-house, and remotely on projects for leading brands, agencies, startups, and charities. I care deeply about creating world-class, useful, and beautiful products that help people and make a difference. I can be as involved in your project as you need me to be; from the seed of the idea, to sketches, creative direction, design, copywriting, system design, and even the front-end and WordPress build.</div>
            <div class="exp-title">Experience</div>
            <div class="words">I’ve been doing this professionally for 15 years. In 2014 I was invited overseas to the United States to take on a lead role as the solo product designer and creative director of a new Adobe product. Pre-2014 I was a freelance web designer and front-end developer for clients around the world, and a product designer at Believe.in. More recently, in 2016/17 I led a small team of designers and pioneeered design systems and digital brand guidelines at WeWork.</div>
